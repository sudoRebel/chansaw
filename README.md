# 🖥️ LTM - Linux Task Manager (CLI)

A lightweight, interactive, high-performance Linux Command-Line Task Manager written in standard C++. It interacts directly with the Linux Kernel via the `/proc` pseudo-filesystem to monitor active processes and manage them using POSIX system signals.

# 🚀 Recent Updates & Performance Optimizations
* **Engine Refactoring (From Tokenization to Stream Parsing)**: Upgraded the `/proc/[PID]/status` parser by replacing the old word-by-word stream extraction (`statusFile >> word`) with an advanced **`std::getline()`** and **`std::string::find()`** implementation.
  * **Why this matters**: The old method was prone to tokenization misalignment and high CPU overhead. The new `getline` stream-based approach scans memory structures line-by-line via the kernel buffer, dramatically increasing extraction speed and mitigating parsing dead-ends.

# ✨ Features
* **Zero-Dependency**: Standard C++ library only.
* **Kernel Direct-Access**: Reads directly from the `/proc` filesystem.
* **PID Mapping**: Identifies active processes.
* **Interactive CLI Interface**: Real-time process monitoring with custom action loops (Refresh/Exit).
* **Process Management**: Send kernel signals (`SIGKILL`) to terminate any task instantly via PID.
* **Smart Memory Auto-Scaling**: Displays memory consumption dynamically in Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, or Petabytes based on real usage.
* **Crash Resilience**: Built-in exception handling to survive dynamic kernel thread shifts.

# 💡 How it works
1. **Discovery**: Scans the `/proc` directory for PID-named folders using `dirent.h`.
2. **Filtering**: Uses `isdigit()` to isolate system processes.
3. **Extraction**: Parses `/proc/[PID]/status` to retrieve the process name and RAM usage (`VmRSS`).
4. **Interactivity**: Captures user input to safely dispatch POSIX signals or trigger dynamic terminal redraws using `system("clear")`.
